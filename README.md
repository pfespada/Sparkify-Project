## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is a project made for the final capstone Udacity project for the Data Scientist Nanodegree.

The motivation of this project is to make a Machine Learning model to predict the Churn in a streaming music app ( 
fictional).

I made this project using a Users log dataset of two month where basic information about user is contained as well as informationa about the interactions in each session. 

So I made a EDA in order to undertand the data and then selected the most relevante features in order to use them in the ML model to predict when a user will cancell his account.
